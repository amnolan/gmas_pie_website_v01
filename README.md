# gmas_pie_website_v01
An assignment where you have to build a site which looks exactly like a picture using vanilla HTML, CSS.

The first site was supposed to be a "basic" index page. I spruced it up a bit. Nothing too fancy though. Note the "Join the World Pie Federation" link, I thought that was a nice touch.

The core of the challenge was supposed to be in "eyeballing" a pdf image and recreating it exactly by hand. It wasn't too hard as everything was vertically stacked.
